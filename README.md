# DeepLearning_Sports_Object_Tracing

The notebook run_experiment.ipynb is designed to run deep learning experiments, likely for a badminton-related project. Based on the context and typical structure, hereâ€™s a description:

**Notebook Description:**

This notebook provides a workflow for running deep learning experiments using PyTorch and ONNX Runtime with DirectML for AMD GPU acceleration on Windows. It includes:

Importing and setting up required libraries for data processing, model building, and GPU acceleration.
Loading and preprocessing badminton-related datasets.
Defining and training deep learning models (such as neural networks) using PyTorch.
Optionally exporting models to ONNX format for inference with ONNX Runtime DirectML, enabling GPU acceleration on AMD hardware.
Evaluating model performance and visualizing results.
The notebook is structured to help users leverage AMD GPUs for efficient deep learning experimentation on Windows platforms
